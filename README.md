semtracking
=======

Find particles in SEM images. Example usage is shown in the ``examples`` folder.
If you use the code in ``examples/open_all_tifs_in_directory.py``, images will be saved in the ``fits`` folder and the data will be stored in ``.csv`` format in the ``report`` folder.
You can then use the images to identify circles that are not particles and exclude these from your measurement.
